  {
    title: "What is Urgency?",
    body: "Ethical urgency is about timing and logistics (routes/crew availability), not scare tactics. It helps homeowners act while the opportunity is efficient for both sides."
  },
  {
    title: "Anchor Early",
    body: "Frame urgency in the opener: we’re already routed here, so inspections now/soon are the most efficient and keep you on the current route."
  },
  {
    title: "Scarcity That’s Real",
    body: "Reference real schedule scarcity: 'We only have two inspection windows while crews are in your sector today/tomorrow.'"
  },
  {
    title: "Two-Option Close",
    body: "Use specific times: 'We can do 5:40 today or 6:10 tomorrow—what’s better for you?' Specific beats vague."
  },
  {
    title: "Reinforce at Scheduling",
    body: "When you pick a time, remind: 'That locks you into the current route so the team can get you the most efficient look.'"
  },
  {
    title: "Avoid Manipulation",
    body: "No fake deadlines or threats. Tie urgency to routing, crew proximity, and homeowners’ convenience."
  },
  {
    title: "Micro-Urgency",
    body: "Short, calm nudges: 'While we’re here', 'to keep you on this route', 'so you don’t get bumped to next month.'"
  },
  {
    title: "Practice Scenario",
    body: "Homeowner: 'Maybe later.' You: Acknowledge + offer two concrete windows while crews are nearby."
  }
