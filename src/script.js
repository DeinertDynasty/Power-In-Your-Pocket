   "Hello, how are you today?",
  "Sorry to bother you. I'm Phoenix from Power Home Remodeling.",

  "We just finished a window installation in the neighborhood and I noticed you have similar aged windows to the ones we just replaced.",
  "And while we're in the neighborhood we're giving ALL of the neighbors a free estimate.",
  "Our experts will be in the neighborhood all day today, or does tomorrow work better for you?",

 
  "Ohhh okay, the windows are just something you're putting off for the future then.",

  "That's actually perfect.",
  "The estimate is completely free. There's no obligation and it's guaranteed in writing for the future.",

  
  "My name is Phoenix, what's your name by the way? Pleasure to meet you.",
  "How long have you owned the home?",
  "Where are you from originally?",
  "What was it about this neighborhood that made you want to move here?",

 
  "I'll just make a note that we spoke and leave you with some information.",

 
  "Most of your neighbors have been saying they have 15-20 windows.",
  "Does that sound about right for you?",
  "And they are all the original wood, right?",

 
  "And the zipcode here is still 12345, right?",
  "And we are in Pittsburgh, PA, right?",

  
  "And the address here is 123 Easy Street, correct?",

  "And your cell phone, is that a 412 or a 724?",
  "And your alternate number, is that also a ... ?",

 
  "And h/o, how do you spell your last name?",

  "And your email address, is that a Yahoo or a Gmail?",


  "Now, h/o, is it just you here or both you and a significant other?",
  "And what is your s/o's name? OR Okay great, does anyone else own the home with you?",
  "And s/o's cell phone, is that also a 412 or a 724?",


  "Just to let you know the estimate is really easy.",
  "All our expert will do is measure everything up, come inside to answer any questions you have, and leave you with the estimate.",
  "So when is usually the best time to catch both you and s/o home together, would that be the mornings or the evenings?",



  "What time do you usually get home?",
  "What time does your s/o usually get home?",

  "What time do you normally leave for work?",
  "What time does your s/o usually leave for work?",


  "We ARE seeing some of your neighbors later today.",
  "What I will do for you is have my expert come over today at X or does X time work better for you?",


  "We ARE seeing some of your neighbors early tomorrow.",
  "What I will do for you is have my expert come over tomorrow at X or does X time work better for you?",

 
  "Great. So X time works for you?",
  "And does that work for s/o?",
  "And do either of you have any plans we would be stepping on?",

 
  "Great, I'm going to give a call to my Scheduling Department to make sure that day and time is available.",


  "Hey Caitlyn, it's Phoenix Nitro ID 179 923, with the Pittsburgh Community. I'm speaking with h/o and we're giving her and her s/o a free estimate on 15 windows.",
  "H/o was saying X day and time would be best.",

 
  "Okay, h/o, this is my Scheduling Agent, Caitlyn.",
  "She is going to need to speak WITH you. She will ask you some questions, like your zip code, address, and some of the basic information we just discussed. Then she will look at the schedule and get you that time ... say hi!",

  
  "Thank you so much for your time.",
  "Give me two seconds and I'll get you right back to the rest of your day.",
  "Actually, go grab your cell phone for me, I'm going to leave you with our contact information.",


  "We have you and s/o all set for X day and time.",

  
  "Did Caitlyn mention we would be giving you a call?",
  "Okay, that will be coming from a 412 area code. Just make sure you pick that up.",
  "It will be one of our dispatchers letting you know we are on our way to your home.",

 
  "Now, in your cell phone go to your camera, scan this. This is going to give you our contact information. That way you know it's us when we give you a call.",


  "Most importantly, you don't have to do this.",
  "If there is any reason at all that you would cancel this estimate, just let me know now, because it's a poor reflection on me.",
  "Are you sure X day and time works for you both?",


  "Now, I know that s/o wasn't here for all of this, so I will need your help to let them know that the estimate is completely free, there are no obligations, and it will be guaranteed in writing if you ever want to put it to use.",

"So we would just love to come see you together, one time, so we can be accurate and put our best foot forward.",

"How long does the estimate take?",
"Well, the estimate is really easy.",
"They just measure up the windows, answer any questions you have, and leave you with the estimate.",

"It just depends on how many questions you have.",

"Do they need to come inside?",
"The estimate is really easy. All our expert will do is come out measure up with windows, go over your styles and options from inside the home and leave you with the estimate but, they won’t be there all night.",
"How much does an item cost?",
"Unfortunately, I don’t really deal with the pricing. We’re not the cheapest, we’re not nearly the most expensive, but, we pride ourselves on having the best value in the industry.",

"And when my expert comes out, they’ll get as specific as you’d like with the numbers.",

"Any technical questions.",
"That’s a really great question and when our expert comes out, they will be able to answer all of your questions."

"I need to speak to my s/o first.",
"Ok, no worries, I’ll just make a note that we spoke and leave you with some information to show them.",

  "That day will never come…",
  "Unfortunately, most people wait until water has infiltrated their windows.",
  "That’s why most of your neighbors are taking advantage of the estimate now,",
  "That way they can plan ahead, instead of being on Mother Nature’s terms.",
